# Chess Sorceress

A game of Chess that runs in the browser, with an AI opponent (The Chess Sorceress). Written as a project for the Accelerated JavaScript class taught at Juno in Fall of 2019.

## Features

- A fancy prompt to decide how you want to promote your pawns.
- An AI that will try to beat you at Chess, with moderate success.
